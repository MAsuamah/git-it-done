## How to Use

### Search to Find Repositories
Search by username by entering any GitHub username in the username search bar and submitting the form. You will also have the option of searching by topic with the options of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Click on one of the languages in the "Search by Topic" box and repositories which feature the selected language will populate on the right-hand side of the screen.

### View the Issues and Pull Requests

Once the list of repositories are populated, click on any project of interest to be taken to their issues and pull requests. Click on an issue/pull request to be redirected to the GitHub issue/pull request page.
